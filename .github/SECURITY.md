# Security Policy

If you think you've identified a security issue with *gpx*, **do not open a public issue**. Instead, to responsibly disclose a security issue, [report a vulnerability via GitHub's security advisory form](https://github.com/sgraaf/gpx/security/advisories/new), or report it by email to [Steven van de Graaf](mailto:steven@vandegraaf.xyz).
